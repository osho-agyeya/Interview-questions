Each node in a tree generally has utmost 1 parent and 2 children, in the given tree each node can have utmost 2 parents and 2 children. Each node had a value associated with it. I had to find the maximum sum that I can get by traversing from the root to the leaf most efficient manner. The values of each node can be negative too. I had to solve this in O(n).  To solve this I had used Dynamic Programming.

You have M identical ropes and N identical weights. You want to do an experiment to determine the strength S of the identical ropes, by testing how many weights can be held by one single rope. The strength S of the ropes is defined as:
1) If a rope breaks with the first weight, S=0;
2) If a rope can hold n weights and breaks at n+1 weights, S=n;
3) If a rope can hold all N weights, S=N.
In one test (“test” means to check if one rope can hold an amount of weights), if the rope breaks, you have to take another rope to continue the experiment; if the rope does not break, it can be used for the next test with no problem. If you used up all the ropes but still cannot determine the strength S of the ropes, the experiment fails.
Please write a C/C++ program that, given M and N (M and N are both integers, M>=1, N>=1), calculates the minimum number of tests T needed to guarantee you can determine S. Try to optimize the time complexity of your program, and explain:
1) What kind of “tricks” you have used to optimize the time complexity?
2) What is the time complexity without these “tricks” and what is the time complexity with these “tricks”?
Hint 1: If you have limited number of ropes, you don’t dare to take the risk. For example, if M=1, your only choice is to increase the weights one by one, from 1 to N, to make sure you can determine S in the worst case. In this case, T=N.
Hint 2: If you have lots of ropes, binary search is obviously helpful to calculate the minimum T efficiently.
Example 1: M=1, N=20
Command: calc_n_tests 1 20
Output: 20
Example 2: M=2, N=5
Command: calc_n_tests 2 5
Output: 3

-The question was to find the right view of the tree 

We have a company where unique alias has to be allotted to all the employees and an alias is the smallest unique prefix of the employees’ name. Here, same alias cannot be given more than once say for 6 Tanyas, alias would be T, Ta, Tan, Tany, Tanya, Tanya_2 respectively and for the last Tanya since the complete name has been taken before so the alias would be the name appended by the number of times the alias has been repeated. I suggested the use of Tries with storing the count for every alias that is allotted and he asked me to return the alias for every new employee who comes.
Find the maximum length of subarray where the product of array elements = the LCM of those elements. I suggested him the use of GCD here because the GCD would be 1 for the elements that satisfy this condition. He gave me a range so the final solution that I proposed was to store unique prime factors of all the numbers before and then find the range in a single traversal, keeping track of the start and end.

How does a server respond to a client’s request and how is the connection established. Then I was asked questions around cryptography and the Digital Signature algorithm. He then asked me why Amazon and why not the other companies that you have offers with.

This round was a bar raiser round so they asked easy technical questions and was focused on principle based skills as well. He started off with asking the condition of a tree being balanced and then asking the code for it. Then he asked me for code to check if an array is a subarray of other array. He didn’t want the usage of extra space. He asked me about the sorting algorithms that I know of and pointers about each. Then he asked me about deadlock and how can it be resolved using code. Then another interviewer joined and they asked about situation where I faced deadlock and how I overcame that. I was asked about situations where I took the ownership and stuff like these. Remember their principles and build your answers around them. This round lasted for around 40 minutes.

The second problem was based on Round Robin Scheduling. Given n processes, their arrival times and burst times, it was required to calculate the average waiting time using Round Robin scheduling.        The Round Robin scheduling was not explained in great detail in the problem, hence a lot of students failed to solve the problem. I was well aware with the working of Round Robin scheduling, so I             was able to solve both the problems and thus made it to the interviews

It was a easy question to reverse a string taken k length at a time. i.e. Input: String=”amazoninterview”, k=5   Output: “ozamaetninweivr”
It was a basic graph problem. click here

first question was to count the number of set bits in a given range (a, b). the question was really easy and i was able to do it in time complexity O(n*log(d)) and space complexity O(1). and he was satisfied with the answer.

second question was, there is an infinite grid in first quadrant and a sequence of coordinate of first quadrant in particular order and one can move in all 8 directions from a point in grid . you have to calculate the minimum number of steps to reach the last indexed coordinate of sequence following the same order as sequence. At first i explained BFS approach but he told to reduce the time complexity and then i was able to do it in O(n).(explanation: move to an intermediate node diagonally and then take the manhattan distance).

infinite grid problem

There are 3 sorted arrays({A1, A2, A3}) and you have to computer number of triplet {i, j, k} such that {i, j, k} belongs to {A1, A2, A3} respectively and i<j<k. and he asked to write code clearly and should not fail for any edge case. and i was able to do it in linear time Complexity and without any extra space. and he was satisfied with my answer. and again we discussed about company for approx 5-10 minutes.

Operating System: There is a game which requires 4GB RAM memory and i have a system with 2GB RAM. Then which concept the system will use to run the game.

Computer Network: How any url is processed in details like how it find DNS server etc.

DBMS: which properties RDBMS should follow? then what is normalization and denormalization and why we need it explain with example.

Then He asked, There is a tree having node values as ‘T’ and ‘F’ only. write a function which should return the largest subtree having equal number of ‘T’ and ‘F’ nodes. I was able to do it in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity and he was satisfied with answer.

after that he asked There is a sorted array in which except one element all elements have a duplicate number. write program to find unique element from array .First I told him XOr approach and checking next number if it is equal or not all in O(n) approach. then i told him O(log(n)) approach using binary search and then he was satisfied with answer.

then after, He told to reduce the complexity of searching in linked list by using any data structure or changing the node structure. at first i told him to use hash map but there can be duplicate data so he rejected this approach. Then after i was able to give 2 approaches .by using array of pointers which maintains middle element in every go of binary search and by using skip lists.

hen he asked to find the number of nodes in linked list which is outside of loop of linked list. He wanted to know the floyd algorithm and asked why it is correct and give arithmetical expression for this and then he asked to write code.


Again He asked question from linked list. There is a linked list having an extra pointer random pointer which points to any random node of linked list. And you have to clone the linked list. At first i was able to do it in O(n) space complexity but he asked for O(1) space complexity. then i was able to do it without using any extra space.

Fourth technical round:
1.Asked me about my internship project.

2.Why we use RNN and what is the difference between RNN and CNN.

3. Question based on system design.

This question was little bit hard. The question was that there is a mad scientist who has various solution.I was given an array that contains the volume of each solution. The scientist can mix any two adjacent solution. let’s say two adjacent solution having volume a and b then the resultant solution will produce smoke volume of (a*b) and liquid of (a+b) %100. Now i was asked to find a way such that all over smoke produced is minimum.               Hint: Use same approach as chain multiplication.
Last question of this round was to convert a source string to target string such that at any time you can change only one alphabet of the string and resultant string (at each alteration) must be present in a dictionary which was provided at the beginning.I had to find the minimum number of alteration. I gave him a bfs approach.

I was asked to print to node of a binary tree in reverse zig zag order.
The second question was to tell number of islands present. 1 represents land while 0 represents water in the given matrix. adjecent 1’s comes under single islands. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-of-islands/
After that they asked a nested sql query. and then asked about types of join in dbms(inner and outer).

I was given two strings one contains only alphabets and another contains alphabets, dot(.) and star(*). dot represents any one character and a star can represent any number of alphabets including 0 also. and I had to check whether both string match or not.
At last we talked about my project, he asked what i had  done during my internship, and what challenges i faced during that.
Then he asked some question on Operation System including demand paging and thrashing.

Round 1:It was coding test in which two coding question and 28 mcq related to data structure and C++.There were different set of papers in my case one coding question is convert infix to prefix and another is find mean, median and sum in array.After this round 33 select for interview.

Round 2:It was first interview round in which interviewer first discussed related to project then asked two question.It was problem solving round.

1.Generate two number from given digit of array b/w 0 to 9 such that if length of array is even then number of digit in each number should be equal if odd the digit difference b/w number should be 1.Use count sort  and in this case some edge case missed so detect that edge case(like 1000 in this 10, 0 digit is not equal but length of array is even).Write code on pan and paper.



2.Detect Cycle in Directed graph.Write code on pan and paper.

Round 3:It was second Interview round she asked me three question related to data structure.

1.Search in infinite array First i told the binary search using fix upper limit as power of 2 and increment it.Then Interviewer asked me 2^1000 and 2^1001 there is huge diffrence b/w them so can you do it in efficient manner.I came with fix upper limit as multiple of 2. Interviewer was satisfied with my approach.She said write code on pan and paper.

2.Find the intresection point in linked list direct from gfg .I told solution and she was satisfied.

3.It was related to min heap and write code on pan and paper.I told solution and she was satisfied and said that we will come back for next round.

Round 4:He asked me three problem

1.Find Majority element in an array.I first told take map then he said extra space is not allowed.I gave second approach using sorting but he said do in o(n).Then I told efficient solution in o(n) because i already discussed that code with my friend.He was satisfied and said Nice.But he said have you done it before i said yes i have done it before 2-3 month then he was happy.

2.related to binary tree find maximum sum path i have done it using recursion.

3.circular patrol pump i told approach and then he said ok.

After this he discussed related to some topic deadlock, semaphore, mutex, critical section, ACID property.etc.

Round 5:4 student were select for this round.It was HR round in this he asked some question related to project and then asked np-complete problem, max heapify code, scc(strongly connected component).

Evaluation of postfix expression. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-set-4-evaluation-postfix-expression/
Round 2:

This round lasted for 60 minutes. It was a F2F round and the interviewer was nice. He asked me two problems.

there are n staircases and a person has to go to nth stair he can take any number of steps based on his age, for eg. if his age is 5 then he can take 1 step, or 2 steps or 3 steps or 4 steps or 5 steps. I gave the solution and then he asked for complexity and then asked me to optimize it.
There is a graph, we can go from one node to other node either for free or for a cost(that cost is the same for each path). Find the path which connects the source to destination with min cost. I answered it but my approach was not good enough so he helped me out for the same.
At last, he asked me to code the solution for both the question.

Round 3:

This round was again F2F and lasted for 75 min.

The interviewer asked me a few ques about OS. and then two coding questions.

print the path between two nodes of the Binary Tree. I gave the approach but was unable to code.
how will you find a k largest elements in a file(containing integers) of the size of 1 GB.
Round 4:

This round was F2F and lasted for 60 min.

The interviewer asked me 1 ques. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/

I gave him approach and then he asked me to code it. I was unable to it.


Then he asked me that I have any question for him so I asked a few ques.

 

After this HR round was there but I was not selected for it.

It was a nice experience.

Round 1:(Online Assessment – 2 hours)

The online assessment consist of 4 parts.In first part we have to debug 7 codes in 15 minutes.The second part comprised of 24 logical reasoning question which had to be done in 35 minutes.The third part consists of 2 coding questions that had to be done in 70 minutes.The debugging part and the logical reasoning questions were very easy.

The 2 coding questions were



1: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pair-with-largest-sum-which-is-less-than-k-in-the-array/ . I have done it in O(nlogn) by first sorting the array then using binary search.The solutions with O(n^2) time complexity were also accepted.

2: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-round-robin-scheduling-set-1/ .The second question was to find out the average waiting time of processes in Round Robin scheduling.It can easily be done using Queue data structure.

In the fourth part we were given some questions on work ethics which were to be answered honestly and carried a weightage.Some students who had done both the coding questions and had not answered these questions carefully were not shortlisted for the next round and the students who had answered this part carefully and had done only one coding question were shortlisted.

The online round was very easy and I had done both the coding questions .

Out of around 250 students 52 were shortlisted for next round.

Round 2:(Face to Face interview – 1 hour)

This round begins with a brief discussion on my project and the interviewer asked about the algorithms that i have used in it.He then asked me 2 coding questions

1:  https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/resources/compress-decompression/ .The question was to decompress the compressed string.I solved it using a stack of strings.He then asked me to code my approach on paper so that all corner cases are covered.He then gave me 2 or 3 test cases and asked me to dry run my code on these test cases.He was very impressed by my approach.

2: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/ .He then asks me another question which was an application of topological sorting in Directed Acyclic Graph and asked me to code topological sort algorithm on paper.

He then asked me whether I have an interest in Computer Networking or not.I said that CN is not one of my favourite subjects and my favourite subjects are OS and DBMS.He then start asking questions from OS and DBMS.


He asked the data structures that are used in DBMS, indexing concept in DBMS, insertion in B trees, ACID properties and the difference between thread and process in OS.He was satisfied by all of my answers as I had prepared all of core CS subjects for the interview.

Usually Amazon SDE-2 interviews happens in 2 days schedule. On the 1st day there will be 3 rounds (PS/DS and design rounds). If the feedback is good you then will be called for remaining 2 rounds which are Manager and Bar raiser.

In my case date of joining was very close in some other org, so all 5 rounds happened on one day.



Round 1 PS/DS:
Q1.
Given a binary tree you have to print endmost node in zig zag fashion.
Example:

1
/     \
2        3
/     \    /    \
4     5   6    7
\
8

Output should be : 1, 3, 4, 8
Soln: Level Order traversal using node count approach and using flag to decide which node end you have to print (leftmost or rightmost)

Q2. Given snake and ladder board you have to find minimum no. of move required to reach end of board.
Soln: BFS (link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snake-ladder-problem-2/)

Round 2: PS/DS

Q1) Given following piece of code and two int arrays A & B of equal size n, explain what is it doing.

ans = 0;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
for(int k=0;k<n;k++){

if(A[i]!=B[i] && A[j] ! = B[k] && A[k]!=B[k]){ ans = max(ans, A[i] + A[j] + A[k]);}

}

Sol’n: Basically this code is finding max sum triplet from A array such that value in those indexes of B array  is different.


Next he asked me to re write this code with better time complexity.

Q2.  Given a binary tree, find path in the tree such that the sum of nodes in path is equal to given K. Path can start from any nodes and can end on any nodes.

1
/     \
2          3
/     \    /    \
4     5   6    7
\
8

Example : for k = 10, there will be 2 paths: 1->3-> 6 and 3->7

Use following concept:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-subarray-with-given-sum-in-array-of-integers/

Round 3: Design

Design Dominoes website. This was mainly focused on High level design and you have to mention all the major components like Delivery tracking system, User Signup/Login flow, Fulfillment service etc.
You have to describe complete flow of a order until its delivery to customer.
Interviewer also asked me to write schema details for few entities.

Round 4: Manager

In the first of half of this round we mostly discussed about my work experience and role which is played in my current team.
In the second half he asked me to design Job management system where user submits a job and specify the time its should run just like Airflow app.


Round 5: Bar raiser
This one was mostly discussion oriented to judge on the basis of Amazon leadership principles. You have to mention few scenarios about your work and how you have applied those leadership principles.

1. Inversion count in the array



2. Postfix evaluation (handle negative number also)

3. Mean median mode in array

4. Dice throw puzzle(DP)

5.Roots of quadratic equation

6.Linear equation in one variable

7.Longest common subsequence

8.Evaluate Infix operation (handle negative number also)

MCQ’s were difficult and required deep knowledge of DSA and C C++.

Out of around 350 students 53 were called for interview.

 

Round 1:

Interview lasted for 25 minutes and had a detailed discussion on 2 questions. He directly started with a coding question.

given a string encode it. Eg. aaabb -> a3b2
there are n person with their height and weight given. You have to select maximum number of person that can stand in a queue with condition that height and weight of person in queue will always be less or equal to next person.you have to return persons not the count. (LIS)
This round went well and I was immediately called for next round.

Round 2: 

This round lasted for 30 minutes.

Given k arrays of size n each. You have to select one number from each of them such that the difference between them is minimum. Initially, the question was for 3 arrays, I told him the solution quickly then he changed 3 to k.
Implent AVL.
a question on designing a data structure I don’t remember. I used hash for that. He asked me about hash worst time complexity, ideas to improve it.
A question on trie.
median of running stream of integers.
Given an array of n integers ranging from 1-n-2, in which every integer comes once and two integer comes twice, find both of them.
I had to write code for every question. This interview also went well and I was called for next round immediately.

Round 3:

This round went for 90minutes. This was different from previous two. It was more of a discussion round.

Project discussion.
Range Sum query with update. I told him prefix sum. He wanted better approach. I told him segment tree.
He then asked range update in best optimised way. I told him Lazy propogation.  I had to write code for segment tree with lazy propogation.
1 hour discussion on networks. (I told him I haven’t revised but he kept on asking)
This round also went well. In networks he provided some input whenever I needed. Since it was late my next round was scheduled next day.

Round 4(Bar raiser)


This round went for approx 1 hour.

Wildcard Pattern Matching. I discussed all corner cases and base cases along with recurrence relation. He asked me to write code in bottom up dp. He was really happy with my solution.
 Design a data structure for running stream of string. You have to print a word if it has not come within 10 second else ignore it. You have to manage memory in most optimal way. I discussed the various approach using trie, hash, lru. When I told him my solution with queue and hash, He was surprised an told me that he didn’t thought of that solution. He asked me to code it.
project discussion.
oops- How abstract class is implemented by compiler. When I told him the solution he said awesome.
