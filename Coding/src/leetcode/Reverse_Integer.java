/* over, n, 
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21
Example 4:

Input: x = 0
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1 */

	 * Approach 1: Pop and Push Digits & Check before Overflow
Intuition

We can build up the reverse integer one digit at a time. While doing so, we can check beforehand whether or not appending another digit would cause overflow.

Algorithm

Reversing an integer can be done similarly to reversing a string.

We want to repeatedly "pop" the last digit off of xx and "push" it to the back of the \text{rev}rev. In the end, \text{rev}rev will be the reverse of the xx.

To "pop" and "push" digits without the help of some auxiliary stack/array, we can use math.

//pop operation:
pop = x % 10;
x /= 10;

//push operation:
temp = rev * 10 + pop;
rev = temp;
However, this approach is dangerous, because the statement \text{temp} = \text{rev} \cdot 10 + \text{pop}temp=rev⋅10+pop can cause overflow.

Luckily, it is easy to check beforehand whether or this statement would cause an overflow.

To explain, lets assume that \text{rev}rev is positive.

If temp = \text{rev} \cdot 10 + \text{pop}temp=rev⋅10+pop causes overflow, then it must be that \text{rev} \geq \frac{INTMAX}{10}rev≥ 
10
INTMAX
​
 
If \text{rev} > \frac{INTMAX}{10}rev> 
10
INTMAX
​
 , then temp = \text{rev} \cdot 10 + \text{pop}temp=rev⋅10+pop is guaranteed to overflow.
If \text{rev} == \frac{INTMAX}{10}rev== 
10
INTMAX
​
 , then temp = \text{rev} \cdot 10 + \text{pop}temp=rev⋅10+pop will overflow if and only if \text{pop} > 7pop>7
Similar logic can be applied when \text{rev}rev is negative.


Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(\log(x))O(log(x)). There are roughly \log_{10}(x)log 
10
​
 (x) digits in xx.
Space Complexity: O(1)O(1).
