/* over, |S|+|T|, 1
 * 
 * Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
Example 2:

Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
Example 3:

Input: s = "a##c", t = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "c".
Example 4:

Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200
s and t only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

	 * Intuition
The intuition and quick methode is to find the final text result.
You can just use a string if you don't care cost on string modification.
Or you can use a stack or string builder to do it in O(N).

Use stack to avoid string modification.
Time O(N) and space O(N).

    def backspaceCompare(self, S, T):
        def back(res, c):
            if c != '#': res.append(c)
            elif res: res.pop()
            return res
        return reduce(back, S, []) == reduce(back, T, [])

Follow up: O(1) Space
Can you do it in O(N) time and O(1) space?
I believe you have one difficulty here:
When we meet a char, we are not sure if it will be still there or be deleted.

However, we can do a back string compare (just like the title of problem).
If we do it backward, we meet a char and we can be sure this char won't be deleted.
If we meet a '#', it tell us we need to skip next lowercase char.

The idea is that, read next letter from end to start.
If we meet #, we increase the number we need to step back, until back = 0

        int i = S.length() - 1, j = T.length() - 1, back;

            back = 0;
            while (i >= 0 && (back > 0 || S.charAt(i) == '#')) {
                back += S.charAt(i) == '#' ? 1 : -1;
                i--;
            }
            back = 0;
            while (j >= 0 && (back > 0 || T.charAt(j) == '#')) {
                back += T.charAt(j) == '#' ? 1 : -1;
                j--;
            }
