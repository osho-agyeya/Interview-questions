 * 
 * Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target. 
Note:
Given target value is a floating point.
You may assume k is always valid, that is: k ≤ total nodes.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

Follow up:
Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?  */
